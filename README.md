# Smart-Sorting-Transfer-Learning-for-Identifying-Rotten-Fruits-and-Vegetables
Smart Sorting Transfer Learning for Identifying Rotten Fruits and Vegetables
## 🔍 Overview
**Smart Sorting** is a deep learning-based web application that classifies images of fruits and vegetables as **fresh or rotten** using **transfer learning with EfficientNetB0**. It aims to reduce food waste and assist in **automated quality control** for supermarkets, smart kitchens, and food processing industries.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a lightweight, intelligent, and real-time fruit & vegetable freshness detection system that:
- Minimizes food spoilage and manual errors.
- Provides a deployable web interface for predictions.
- Helps in smart home and retail automation.
