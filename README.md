# Smart Sorting: Transfer Learning for Identifying Rotten Fruits and Vegetables

## üîç Overview
**Smart Sorting** is a deep learning-based web application that classifies images of fruits and vegetables as **fresh** or **rotten** using **transfer learning with EfficientNetB0**. It aims to reduce food waste and assist in **automated quality control** for supermarkets, smart kitchens, and food processing industries.

## üéØ Objective
To build a lightweight, intelligent, and real-time fruit & vegetable freshness detection system that:
- Minimizes food spoilage and manual errors.
- Provides a deployable web interface for predictions.
- Supports smart home and retail automation.
